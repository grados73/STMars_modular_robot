## General info
It is educational SMARS project based on STM32 BlackPill. I created this project to learn how to develop projects on STM32 and how to use my own 3D Printer.

STMars has two modes of working, the first one is remote control via Bluetooth, using a phone and HC-05 module, second mode is the ability to drive autonomously and avoid obstacles.
